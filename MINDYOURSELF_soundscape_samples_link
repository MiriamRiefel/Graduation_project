The samples that can be loaded in into the Ableton Project, should be downloaded from SoundCloud.

They were created specifically for this project.
They should be downloaded into the same folder as the Ableton Project. 

You can download them per track (46 in total) directly from Soundcloud, or download the whole playlist at once via a different application, such as this one

Troubleshooting: 
In case Ableton calls an 'files are missing' error, you can manually refer the tracks inside Ableton to the sample folder where you stored your music samples. 
Many Youtube tutotials, such as this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gwii3Pyk6Xg, help you through this problem.
