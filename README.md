# Graduation_project
In this Github folder you can find all software downloads that were made/adapted by Miriam Riefel specifically for the development of MIND YOURSELF.

This Github page, in combination with the set-up tutorial video and the methodology section of the thesis show the full technical construction of MIND YOURSELF. 
The scripts and videos are uploaded publically such that anyone has access to understanding design/construction choices of the project and can (partially) replicate the project.
 
Please check the full list of dependencies for all accompanying hardware and software that should be downloaded/bought/borrowed. 
This Github page corresponds to the set-up tutorial video: https://youtu.be/3v51ntuLwkg
